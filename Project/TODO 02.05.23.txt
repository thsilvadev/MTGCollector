To do today:

1) create the schema / tables / columns => tried my best to edit the SQL (downloaded EmEditor and whatnot) but couldn't do nothing. So I'm running the whole SQL, thus creating a gigantic database. It's definitely overkill but, hey, I tried. Once it finished creating all those exceding tables and filling'em, I just had to create my own tables (collection, wishlist, decks and deck) and we're good to go.

2) populate it with cards => done

3) try to run the backend => tried it. GetbyId returning empty square brackets. Will need to find out whatÂ´s wrong.

4) try to populate frontend with cards
