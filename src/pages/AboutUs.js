            <h4>I'm thsilvadev but you can call me Thiagosauro, a casual <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> player. I used to play it 13 years ago back in the school days. Classic nerd twelve year olds group started to visit "Pergaminho" (word for Scroll, in english), a RPG store near our school. There we took part in dubious RPG sessions until the dungeon's keepers showed us Magic. It was unbeliavably magical. We all know it is.</h4> <br/>
            <h4>Unfortunately at that time I had to choose between eating/going to the near LAN House and buying cards. So I pretty much stopped playing MTG until recently I bought 467 cards. With that amount, how many decks are possible? Soon I realized, though, I had few good cards I wish to use in more than one deck. But interchanging 'em like that would get a bit confused, I'd had to take notes and... why not make a digital collectior? That's just it! </h4>
